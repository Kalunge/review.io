# code-review-app-api
Learning to code without a community can be devastating, As one who has been through such pain I am creating A tool to help Self Taught developers to get Code reviews from other learners or professional developers. THis is a space where learners can share their PR link and have someone review their code. Hopefully to also grow to the place where code reviewrs can make a coin out of reviewing code from learners or even corporates who would want their code reviewd. Created using TDD Approach and other core Rails  Best practices such as 
- TDD Approach => Request tests, Controller tests, model tests ...
- Exception Handling via custom errorHandlers inheriting from StandardError
- Endpoints protection 
- custom serializers/Representers
- Authentication is done using JWT. 
- Hashing Passwords with Bcrypt for Maximum protections
- LInting using Rubocop to maintain code best practices
- Kanban board for tasks distribution(more  (more Applicable in Team)
- Code Review => Reviewed my own PRs just to add an 'extra eye'
- Database design => associations and relationships
- Git-flow => feature-branch => dev => Main
-
